    "You decide to figure out how to count all of the verbs in a particular literary passage.  In real life, you would most likely use a Python library to assist with this task (go read about NLTK if you want to learn more).  In this exercise, you will be provided with a list of verbs on which to base your search.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to write a function that takes a Python string as input and returns a list of the verbs found inside that string.  Your function only needs to include a verb in the returned list if that verb is also found inside the list named major_verbs.  Leave the definition of major_verbs at the very beginning of your function, as shown in the code below.  Do not change the major_verbs list.  If you change that list, your code will not pass the autograder and will not receive a grade.\n",
